# Covid-19
COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of changes in human life and taught us various life lessons. Symptoms are enough to seek help and get tested but when you also have a dataset related to symptoms, it can help in predicting the mortality rate across regions. That would really help the government and health workers in making key decisions.

### Goal: 
Build a Machine learning model that can predict the mortality rate based on different symptoms and the patientâ€™s condition.

### Data Description: 
Data is collected by health workers from a wide range of patients. This data set consists of a variety of attributes that explains different symptoms and different immunity levels of patients.

### Provided Files:

training_data: This file consists of all features. It should be used for both training and model validation purposes.
test_data: Test file consists of all attributes except the target variable and the prediction is to be made for all the rows in the test file.
Sample_Submission: This file is an example of how the solution file is to be created.

### Evaluation Criteria: 
The metric of evaluation for the prediction is Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The score is calculated by (1-rmse/normalization factor)*100.
